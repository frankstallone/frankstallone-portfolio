      <td width="65%"><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><b>S</b>ometimes it is difficult 
        to tell just what exactly Gohan wants; this may be due to his heritage 
        of being half-Saiyajin and half-Chikyuujin. Shortly after we were introduced 
        to him, we learned that, like his father, he had a great fighter's potential, 
        yet his dream is to become a great scholar. Many have often thought that 
        perhaps this was not his true dream, but the dream he thinks he has, due 
        to Chichi's strong influence. For now, that is unimportant, but what we 
        do know is this: After his uncle, Raditz, arrived on earth, there was 
        a long period of time where he was kept from his dream, yet this period 
        of time helped him to grow and mature the most. What happened? First, 
        Piccolo took him away from his family, and taught him to survive on his 
        own. After his first real battle against Nappa and Vegeta, Gohan, a mere 
        five-year-old boy, had enough courage and power to stand up to opponents 
        many times his size, for the purposes of protecting the weak. Although 
        the warrior blood of Saiyajins flows in his body, Gohan did not enjoy 
        fighting. And while the mix of Saiyajin and human blood seems to have 
        given him a greater power potential, it has also given him a meeker, less 
        violent personality. What Gohan really seems to enjoy is to spend time 
        with the people he loves and respects; his family and friends. However, 
        when Gohan becomes enraged, his Saiyajin nature kicks in; he becomes uncontrollable, 
        like the way we see him during the Cell Game. It is interesting to note 
        that the things that make Gohan angry are not really things that others 
        have done to him, but rather the injustice that he sees around him. Such 
        injustices are what keeps him fighting, even creating his alter egos of 
        "The Golden-Haired Warrior" and "Great Saiyaman." Another cause for the 
        creation of his alter egos is his childhood fighting experience... Gohan 
        started his training with Piccolo at the age of 4, and fought some deadly 
        battles at 5... At the age of 11, about the same age as Gokuu when he 
        was first introduced, he bore the heavy responsibility of protecting the 
        earth against Cell (while Gokuu was roaming around without a care in the 
        world at that age). Luckily, with the return of his father, Gohan can 
        go back to living a relatively normal life, and since he doesn't really 
        enjoy fighting, perhaps it was as much his own will, as it was his mother's, 
        for him to become a great scholar, which he was able to achieve.</font></td>
