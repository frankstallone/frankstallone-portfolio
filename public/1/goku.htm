      <td width="65%"><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><b>G</b>oku or Son Goku, is 
        the main character of DragonBall. When we first meet him in DragonBall, 
        he is a lone boy living on a mountain. Bulma, the second character we 
        meet, tells him about the Dragonballs, which once all 7 are gathered, 
        a single wish may be granted. But the strangest thing about Goku is that 
        the youth has a tail. We soon learn that when Goku sees the full moon 
        he transforms into a giant ape. He goes through DragonBall fighting against 
        three main enimies: Pilaf, The Red Ribbon Army, and Piccolo Diamouh. During 
        this period of time, Goku meets many people on his journeys but the most 
        notable are Krillin, Tien, Chaozu, Yamcha, Puar, Oolong, Chi Chi, (who 
        he marries in the future.) He learns the Kamehameha from Master Roshi, 
        the first person he trains under. The Kamehameha is a basic energy blast 
        which is the most used move in the entire show. Later he trains under 
        Kami who helps him defeat Piccolo Diamouh. Then 3 years later, DragonBallZ 
        begins. A reunion of the DragonBall characters is held, where we meet 
        Gohan, Goku's son. The first enemy that we meet is Radditz, who tells 
        Goku that he is a Sayian, a being from another planet, who eliminate all 
        life from a planet and then sell it for a price to the highest bidder. 
        Radditz tells him that there are only four Sayians left, including Goku 
        and him, after their planet was destroyed. He then tells him that he was 
        sent to Earth as a baby to destroy it, but Goku fell and hurt his head 
        as a child, and lost his "programming." Radditz kidnaps Gohan and tells 
        Goku to kill a hundred people or he will not give his son back. Goku refuses 
        to do this, and teams up with Piccolo (Piccolo Diamouh's son) for a short 
        while and together they defeat Radditz, but Goku dies in the process. 
        As Radditz dies, he tells Piccolo that the other two Sayians will arrive 
        in one year. Goku also learns this, so he crosses Snake Way, which takes 
        him the nine months, to train with the great martial arts master King 
        Kai. King Kai teaches him the Kaioken attack which increases your speed, 
        strength, hearing, sight, and power. This can be done in different degrees 
        like x2 or x3. Goku also learns the Spirit Bomb which is a gathering of 
        the energy of the planet Goku is currently on. On King Kai's planet the 
        Spirit Bomb is small because of the planet's incredibly small size, but 
        if used on Earth, it will be much bigger. After his training is completed, 
        Bulma and Master Roshi, who have gathered the Dragonballs, wish him back 
        to life because the two Sayians, Nappa and Vegeta have arrived. The journey 
        across Snake Way is much quicker this time, taking only a day. But when 
        he arrives he finds that Yamcha, Choazu, Tien, and Piccolo have all been 
        killed by the Sayian Nappa/Sabiamen. Gohan and Krillin are the only ones 
        left living. He gives them each a half of a Senzu bean, and they are healed. 
        He challenges Nappa, and easily defeats him, and in disgust, Vegeta kills 
        his partner. Then there is gigantic battle between Vegeta and Goku, where 
        Goku eventually wins with the help of Krillin,Gohan and even a little 
        help from Yagierobe. In the end, where Krillin is in a position to kill 
        Vegeta, Goku shows his compassion by telling Krillin to let Vegeta live. 
        Krillin reluctantly watches as Vegeta leaves. That's all for now I'll 
        write more later.</font></td>
