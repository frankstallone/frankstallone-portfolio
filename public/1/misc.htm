        Kamesennin's older sister. She can travel safely between Earth (the living 
        universe) and the gatesto heaven & hell (the spirits realm). Apparently, 
        she was at the spirits realm during dangerous times, as we see that when 
        she brings Vegeta back for one day, she doesn't have a halo (a sign that 
        one is dead). </font></p>
      <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><b>E</b>nma-daiou. Gateskeeper and judge 
        of the dead, he was never involved n any of the fights, nor was he close 
        enough to any of the battles to get hurt. The only question is--can we 
        truly consider this guy "alive"? Well, if Kaiou-sama can *die*... </font></p>
      <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><b>M</b>r. Satan. Surprisingly, this arrogant 
        (but lukcy) fool survived through many amazingly powerful opponents. He 
        nearly died when he was shot once, but was healed by Buu just in time. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><b>S</b>outh Kaiou. The only other Kaiou 
        who was introduced in the series, he only showed up once, and has never 
        seen battle in the power of magnitude of the Goku-tachi. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><b>K</b>aiou-shin. The only Kaiou-shin who 
        survived an encounter with Majin Buu, he just got lucky. He also nearly 
        died once, but was found and by the resurrected Kibit. </font></p>

    <td colspan="2" rowspan="5"> 
      <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><b>"Ki-detection"</b> started off not being 
        very specific, but as the series went on, it became more fine-tuned, partly 
        for the development of the story, and of course it is logical to expect 
        its practioners to get better at the art. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">It is somehow a given in oriental cultures 
        that if someone is good at martial arts, he/she must possess a good ability 
        of sensing where his/her enemies are. (When someone has the intent to 
        kill, they give off certain kinds of 'energy'). </font></p>
      <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">First, when DBZ just started, Radditz, Nappa, 
        Vegeta, and Freeza's henchmen used "scouters" to find out people's power 
        level and where its coming from. Scouters are small machines that you 
        wear on your head and tells you ki information. But then as the series 
        went on, they got stronger and can sense ki without scouters. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Near the end of the series, ki-detection 
        is pretty well defined, one not only senses the level of power someone 
        else possesses, they can only get a hint of that person's personality 
        (i.e. good, evil, etc.), and by that personality, they can also get somewhat 
        of a "signature" from that ki. We see evidence of this after Piccolo re-merges 
        with Kami-sama. Cell powers up, so his ki can be sensed by the Z Warriors, 
        and because Cell has the cells of the other fighters, their ki-signatures 
        can be sensed from his ki. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Later, Trunks notices the new Piccolo's 
        ki, but doesn't recognize it (Trunks didn't know Piccolo very well, so 
        he was going more by ki-level), while Krillin quickly recognizes it as 
        Piccolo's ki. Another example is when Goku tried to teleport to Namek. 
        He needed to look for ki-signatures that were similar to that of Piccolo's 
        in order to teleport to the new Namek. </font></p>
