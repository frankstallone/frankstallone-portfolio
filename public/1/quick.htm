      of years ago, the Black star dragonballs were created and scattered across 
      the universe. The Namek dragonballs were also created and scattered across 
      Planet Namek. One set of dragonballs cracked and the evil dragonballs appeared. 
      Seven evil dragons swept across and destroyed the region their dra<img src="hotrunks.gif" width="226" height="309" align="right">gonballs 
      were scattered upon. Some time later in the heavens, Kaiou walks across 
      Snake Way. Years ago, on the Kaiou-shin planet, the Kaiou-shin gods lived 
      peacefully. This ended when Boo terrorized the inhabitants. All the Kaiou-shins 
      were killed except 3: Kaiou-shin (a kid at the time), his partner, and Dai 
      Kaiou-shin. Boo was cursed to have an ugly fat appearance and restrained. 
      Bibi-di, responsible for Boo, failed in his efforts when Boo was defeated. 
      But his son, Babi-di, carries on the mission to re-unleash Boo. On Planet 
      Plant, the Tsufuru-jins lived in peace and developed advanced technology. 
      Out of nowhere, the primative Saiyans landed on the planet. They allied 
      with the Tsufuru-jins. In exchange, the Tsufuru-jins offered their technology 
      (space pods, armor, energy detection glasses, etc.) to the Saiyans. However, 
      the Saiyans, led by Vegeta, eventually betrayed the Tsufuru-jins. War raged. 
      A full moon occurred on the day of the fight and the Saiyans all reached 
      their Oozaru (giant ape) stage. The Tsufuru-jins' weapons were of no match 
      for the Saiyan power and were killed. During the fight, the Tsufuru-jins 
      created Baby to fight the Saiyans, but he was never used in battle. The 
      Saiyans took over the planet. Vegeta renamed the planet to Planet Vegeta 
      and made himself king. Later, a planet conquerer, Freeza, came along. He 
      killed King Vegeta, conquered Planet Vegeta, and used the Saiyans as his 
      mercenaries to conquer other planets. Next, Freeza plotted to destroy Planet 
      Vegeta and a hero named Bardock arose. His story is told in the Bardock 
      Story: Lonely Final Battle. Thus, Planet Vegeta and nearly all the Saiyans 
      were destroyed. Meanwhile, Prince Vegeta and his partner, Nappa, were out 
      destroying other planets. Bardock's eldest son, Raditz, was also away from 
      Planet Vegeta at the time. At the same time, Bardock's youngest son, Kakarot, 
      was sent to <img src="Gokuu-stand.gif" width="195" height="450" align="left">Planet 
      Earth (a Saiyan tradition of sending babies out to destroy weak planets). 
      On Earth, Baby Kakarot was found by Granpa Gohan, a student of Master Roshi, 
      and renamed to Gokou. Gokou was a vicious baby, but after he was dropped 
      on his head, he lost his instinct to destroy the planet. Gokou was raised 
      by Grandpa Gohan. From him, Gokou learned martial arts. One night, a full 
      moon occurred, Gokou reached his Oozaru stage, and smashed Granpa Gohan. 
      When it was all over, Gohan told his grandson never to look at the full 
      moon again, and died. Gokou did not know why or what happened. Afterwards, 
      Gokou lived by himself in the wild (Gohan lived away from civilization.), 
      believing that his grandpa's spirit was in the 4 star dragonball because 
      this ball was left to him as a trinket. Gokou's seclusion ended soon, when 
      he met Bulma (the first girl he had ever seen), the daughter of a scientist 
      and president of Capsule Corpation. This marked the beginning of Dragonball! 
      Then, the two met Oolong, Yamcha, Puar, the Ox-King, Chi-Chi, and Master 
      Roshi in their journey to seek the seven dragonballs. (Oolong wanted to 
      wish for a pair of panties, Yamcha wanted a girlfriend, Bulma wanted a boyfriend, 
      and Gokou simply followed because his "grandpa's" dragonball was used and 
      he wanted adventure.) In this series, our heroes dealt with Pilaf, who fled 
      after having Oozura Gokou destroy his castle. Later, a Tenkaichi Budoukai 
      contest was being held. The gang met Klilyn. Gokou and Klilyn trained under 
      Master Roshi (the Turtle elder) for the tournament. In this contest, the 
      "turtle" team faced the "crane" team, which consisted of Chauzu and Tenshin-han, 
      who trained under the Crane elder, Tsuru-sennin. (Chauzu and Tenshin-han 
      later found out that their master was evil and abandoned him.) Meanwhile, 
      a Namek landed on Earth. This guardian wanted to be pure, so he separated 
      into 2 forms- one good, and one evil. The good Namek became known as Kami. 
      The evil one became Daimao, the Demon King. The two rivaled. Kami seeked 
      Gokou, who was pure of heart, to help. Gokou trained under Kami and Karin-sennin. 
      Gokou fought and killed Daimao, not knowing that Daimao further separated 
      himself into 2 beings- himself, and Piccolo. Dragonball also tells about 
      how Gokou dealt with other villians such as Jackie Chan and Tao Pai-Pai. 
      In another story, Gokou met Red Ribbon, fought, and killed him. (But, Red 
      Ribbon's follower, Dr. Gero, survived. Since then, he had a grudge against 
      Gokou.) After a few years, Gokou grew up (and so did Piccolo). Piccolo met 
      with Gokou to avenge his father, but Piccolo was defeated at the end. Piccolo's 
      life was spared, and Gokou married Chi-Chi. This marked the end of Dragonball. 
      Next, five more years passed. This marked the beginning of Dragonball Z. 
      First, Gokou faces Vegeta, as told in the Vegeta Series. Second, he deals 
      with Freeza in the Freeza Saga. Next, he fights Cell in the Cell Story. 
      Finally, more years pass and the Z gang faces Boo in the Boo Series. This 
      marks the end of Dragonball Z. Now, more years pass and we move on to Dragonball 
      GT. Here, Baby makes his appearance in the Baby Series. Now, our heroes 
      must deal with the evil dragonballs, which is currently airing on TV (in 
      Japan).</font></font></td>
