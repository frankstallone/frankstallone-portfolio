        Ball Z. We first saw someone leaping from tree to tree in the forest. 
        It was Son Goku, getting wood (actually a whole tree) for his wife, Chi-Chi, 
        to cook. Chi-Chi asked Goku where was Gohan. Goku did not know so he went 
        searching for him. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Meanwhile, a circular spaceship crashed 
        onto Earth. A curious farmer looked for the space pod. As the pod opened 
        up, a large stranger, with an appearance similar to Goku but had more 
        hair and was stronger, emerged. The scared farmer took his gun and shot 
        him, but the alien reflected the bullet back at the farmer, killing him. 
        The alien flew and shouted out, "KAKAROTTO!!!" </font></p>
      <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">A little child with a strange hat that held 
        the 4-star dragon ball was lost in the forest. Meet Son Gohan, Goku's 
        son. After meeting a tiger/puma, who later began his friend, he finally 
        fell down a river on a log, shouting "DAD." Goku finally heard his screams 
        and saved him. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Goku and Gohan flew to Kame-House to meet 
        Kuririn, Kamesennin, Bulma, and the Turtle. Suddenly, the alien arrived. 
        He told Goku he was his brother and told him his Saiya-jin origin. (Note: 
        A previous head injury caused Goku to lost his Saiya-jin memory.) The 
        alien, Raditz, told him to bring 100 dead bodies by the next day or Gohan 
        would be lost to him. Piccolo arrived suddenly, told him of his encounter 
        with Raditz, and agreed to team up with him. Because Raditz was very strong, 
        they would have to fight together to win. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><img src="images/image1.jpg" width="170" height="127" align="left">Goku 
        and Piccolo finally found Raditz, and the battle had begin. During the 
        battle, Piccolo lost a limb, and Goku was seriously injured. An enraged 
        Gohan broke out of Raditz's spacepod, which he was trapped in, and attacked 
        Raditz. During Raditz's weaken state, Goku was able to held him until 
        Piccolo executed his secret attack, "MAKANKOUSAPPO." Both Raditz and Goku 
        was killed by the sudden attack. Before Raditz died, he told Piccolo that 
        two stronger Saiya-jins will arrive in one year. Piccolo took Gohan to 
        train with him because he knew that Gohan had great power. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Goku was now in heaven. He was allowed to 
        travel through Serpent Road to Kaiou's planet to train, but he would go 
        to HELL if he fell off. (Note: It was censored to HFIL, Home For Infinite 
        Losers, in the American version.) After running continuously, he got tired 
        but was able to get a ride from a guy that was cleaning Snake Way. When 
        the driver/cleaner was sleeping, Goku fell from the car to HELL. In order 
        to reenter Snake Way, Goku raced two, cool, dumb ogres. When he successfully 
        left HELL, he had to run through Snake Way all over again but was able 
        to regain his strength with an King Yamma's apple. After escaping from 
        Princess Snake, he finally reached Kaiou's planet. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Piccolo left Gohan in a desert alone for 
        six months for survival training. Piccolo later returned and started training 
        him. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">On Kaiou's planet, Goku learned to live 
        under a gravity ten times stronger than Earth's and also learned the Kaioken 
        and Genki-Dama's techniques. (Note: The Genki Dama drew ki energy from 
        everybody on Earth and even the universe. It had been effective many times 
        for Goku during combats.) Kuririn, Tenshinhan, Yamcha, and Chaozu trained 
        with Kami-sama throughout the year. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><img src="images/image2.jpg" width="170" height="127" align="left">The 
        Saiya-jins finally arrived, destroyed a city, and found Gohan and Piccolo. 
        They wanted to kill Raditz's murderers and to get the dragon balls to 
        wish for immortality. Yamchu got killed when one of Nappa's Saiba-men 
        self-destructed. Chaozu and Tien sacrificed their lives to kill Nappa 
        but failed. Piccolo died defending Gohan, a very emotional scene. During 
        the moment, Goku was wished back by the dragon balls and ran rapidly through 
        Snake Way back to Earth. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Luckily, Goku finally arrived to save Gohan 
        and Kuririn by using Kaioken. Vegeta became angry of Nappa's attempts 
        to kill Goku and shouted "SHI NE," destroying him. The battle between 
        Goku and Vegeta began. Vegeta gained an advantage by creating an artificial 
        moon and <img src="images/image3.jpg" width="170" height="127" align="right">transformed 
        into Oozaru form but lost his ability when Yajirobe cowardly cut off his 
        tail with a sword. (Note: The tail allows a Saiya-jin to transform into 
        a giant monkey called Oozaru when a full moon appears. The transformation 
        will be reversed if either the moon disappears or the tail is cut.) Goku 
        was seriously injured while fighting Vegeta and handed his Genki Dama 
        to Kuririn, who then weakened Vegeta with it. Finally, Gohan turned into 
        Oozaru and started beating up Vegeta. With his last amount of strength, 
        Vegeta escaped back in his spacepod. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Bulma and the others arrived to pick up 
        Goku, Kuririn, Gohan, and the bodies of their dead companions. Because 
        of Piccolo's death, Kami also died unfortunately. Without Kami, the dragon 
        balls was not able to exist. Kuririn stated that he heard Vegeta saying 
        that Piccolo came from the planet Namek. By using Kami's spaceship, Bulma, 
        Kuririn, and Gohan traveled to Namek, hoping that there would be more 
        powerful dragon balls to revive their friends. </font></p>

        was finally over, but Kuririn, Bulma, and Gohan must now go to Planet 
        Namek, Piccolo's and Kami's home planet, to obtain another set of dragon 
        balls to wish their allies back. Goku was injured from the battle and 
        was incapable to go, but Kuririn, Bulma, and Gohan were able to obtain 
        the spaceship Kami used to arrive to Earth. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><img src="images/image4.jpg" width="170" height="127" align="left">.The 
        journey was two months long and was filled with dangers, including the 
        Space Ark Children, Raachi and Zaakro (with their abilities to create 
        illusions), and finally Freeza! Freeza was the most powerful being in 
        the universe, who had to undergo through four forms to achieve his real 
        power. After listening to the message from the dying Radditz in the Vegeta 
        Saga, he learned about the dragon balls and decided to pursue them himself 
        to gain immortality.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Altering being healed by a senzu bean, Goku 
        set off for Namek in a specially designed spaceship, training hard in 
        100 times gravity. Meanwhile, Piccolo, Yamcha, Tien, and Chaozu served 
        as Kaiou's pupils. Vegeta was also healed and stronger than ever, heading 
        for Namek for the dragon balls and the hatred for Goku in his black heart. 
        Vegeta was able to kill Dodoria, Kiwi, and Zarbon, becoming stronger after 
        every battle. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><img src="images/image5.jpg" width="170" height="127" align="right">Freeza 
        killed all the Namekians except Nail, Dende, and Saichoro while Vegeta 
        captured all the seven dragon balls (with six from Freeza and one from 
        Kuririn, Bulma, and Bulma). As a desperate measure, Freeza summoned Team 
        Ginew, a team of five strong fighters. Even with their ki increased by 
        Saichoro and with Vegeta assisting them, Kuririn and Gohan were losing 
        to the Ginew Team, allowing them to take the dragon balls to Freeza. Freeza 
        was unable to activate the dragon balls and flew to Saichoro to seek out 
        the answer. Luckily, Goku arrived to defeat Recoom, Recoom, and Jess, 
        allowing Vegeta to kill them, including Guldo. Vegeta wondered if Goku 
        was the legendary Super Saiya-jin. Ginew knew he could not surpass Goku's 
        power so he switched bodies with Goku. The battle concluded with Goku 
        returning to his own body and Ginew trapped in a frog's body. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Gohan, Kuririn, and Dende were able to obtain 
        the dragon balls from Freeza to revive Piccolo and to bring him to Namek. 
        (Note: Unlike Shen-long, Porunga could grant the user three wishes.) Freeza 
        killed Saichoro and injured Nail, interrupting Porunga from granting the 
        third wish (which was to grant Vegeta immortality). An angered Freeza 
        hurt Kuririn and Gohan, but Dende had the ability to heal them. Freeza 
        transformed into his second form, but Piccolo merged with Nail and started 
        beating Freeza. Freeza transformed to his third form while Goku was recovering 
        in Freeza's ship from the battle with Ginew. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><img src="images/image6.jpg" width="170" height="127" align="left">After 
        undergoing his transformation to his fourth and final form, Freeza killed 
        Vegeta for stating about the Super Saiya-jin to Goku. (Note: Freeza feared 
        the Super Saiya-jin legend.) Goku executed a Genki Dama desperately at 
        Freeza, but an injured Freeza killed Kuririn out of rage. This triggered 
        the anger Goku to transform to a Super Saiya-jin. An intense battle has 
        developed, risking the destruction of Namek. <img src="images/image7.jpg" width="170" height="127" align="right"></font></p>
      <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Super Saiya-jin Goku was defeating Freeza, 
        becoming stronger every minute. With his last strength, Freeza triggered 
        the planet to blow up in five minutes and threw Kienzan-like fireballs 
        at him but accidentally got cut in the process. Goku gave Freeza some 
        of his energy to save his live and to fight more but had to kill him rapidly 
        and escape. Goku tried to start Freeza's spaceship but failed as the planet 
        exploded. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Bulma, Piccolo, Gohan, Vegeta, and the Namekians 
        traveled back to earth with the Namek dragon balls. (Note: The Namekians 
        were revived with the Earth dragon balls. Porunga revived Kuririn but 
        was unable to revive Goku. It seemed that Goku survived the explosion 
        and was training on another planet, learning the Shunkanidou in the process. 
        Vegeta decided to train in space, and everything was safe on Earth for 
        now. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><img src="images/freezasagatrunks.jpg" width="160" height="120" align="left">One 
        year later Freeza is put back together in a robotics form by his father, 
        King Cold. They arrive on Earth with an army, all hope is lost by the 
        Z warriors, even Vegeta thinks so when he was revived by the DragonBalls. 
        Suddenly, a teenager comes out of nowhere, beats the crap out of Freeza. 
        Not only that, he is a Saiyan! Turing Super Saiyan, he kills Freeza and 
        King Cold with his sword easily. All he says is that he is waiting for 
        Son Goku, then Son Goku appears out of nowhere. Son Goku tells of his 
        troubles and also demonstrates his new teleportation technique. The teenager 
        says that his name is Trunks. He is also the son of Bulma and Vegeta! 
        He is from the future and comes back in time to warn the Z warriors of 
        androids that will terrorize the world in three years. Trunks also says 
        that Son Goku will die from a heart disease. Trunks though has brought 
        medicine for him. Trunks says that he will come back in three years to 
        fight the androids. Now the Z warriors must train for the androids arriving

      himself into Android #21. He is easily defeated by Vegeta who learns how 
      to turn Super Saiyan during <img src="images/cellfacepic.jpg" width="160" height="120" align="left">his 
      training. Right before he dies, he issues the final command for Android 
      #22 (Cell). Cell is made of single cells from the strongest warriors in 
      the universe. Cell breaks out of his test tube and seeks to absorb #17 and 
      #18. When Cell finally absorbs the androids, he turns into Perfect Cell. 
      No one can offer a challenge so he starts thinking of all the fights as 
      games (Thus somes the title, Cell Game). Cell later announces that he will 
      hold a tournament to the warriors that think they can defeat him. The tournament 
      begins. First, a fighter from Earth, who is really a coward that takes all 
      the credit and is really weak, Mr. Satan. He gets defeated easily by on 
      slap from Cell. Then, Son Goku fights with Cell, the battle ends with the 
      winner Son Goku. But Cell gets so mad that he self-destructs and blow up 
      the whole Solar System. Goku quickly teleports him and himself to a safe 
      distance, like Kaiosama's Planet. He blows up <img src="images/cellvegeta.jpg" width="155" height="134" align="right">killing 
      both Goku and Kaiosama. Everyone was sad, but the battle wasn't over yet, 
      Cell somehow regenerated from just one cell from his body, and decides to 
      take Gohan as his next challenger. He tries to piss off Gohan so that he 
      will be more challenging. The plan works when he creates seven Baby Cells 
      who kills his friends. And he kills Miari Trunks with a surprise attack. 
      Gohan gets pushed off the edge and powers up and reaches SSJ2, then Cell 
      realizes that he over did it. Gohan defeats the Baby Cells with just one 
      kick to each of them. Son Gohan starts to attack Cell. As the battle goes 
      on, Gohan's right arm gets crippled. He creates a Kamehameha, Cell than 
      creates his own Kamehameha, a stalement is drawn only with the encouragement 
      of his dead father. Son Gohan over powers Cell and kills him with only one 
      arm! Everyone is wished back to life except Son Goku because he was already 
      wished back to life once. But Goku was proud of his son and watched over 
      him in the heavens, while King Kaiosama kept on yelling at Goku for bringing 
      Cell to his planet. Miari Trunks later returns to his own time.</font></td>

      the Cell Game. Krillin marries #18 (who was wished to human by the DragonBalls) 
      and has a daughter named Marron. Chi-Chi has a seconded son named Son Goten, 
      Son Goten and Trunks (Chibi) turned SSJ at an early age. Son Gohan has a 
      girl friend named Videl, the daughter of Satan ( Satan takes all the credit 
      for killing Cell, this got him really famous ), Son Gohan is also a superhero 
      named the Great SaiyanMan. During The Tenkaichu-<img src="images/gokoussj3.jpg" width="192" height="254" align="right">Boudoukai, 
      Son Goku is granted a single day of life to meet with Gohan, Goten, Trunks, 
      Chi-Chi, and all the Z warriors, including Vegeta. Two of Buu's slaves steal 
      Son Gohan's energy, then a man named Kaiosen revives Son Gohan, he than 
      tells of a evil demon named Buu trying to destroy the Earth. If Buu's slaves 
      gather enough energy, he will be revived. Vegeta learning that he can become 
      stronger by turning into Buu's slave, Vegeta turns evil again, this time 
      he is Majin Vegeta and can turn to SSJ2. This gives Buu enough energy to 
      be revived. Goku then learns to turn to SSJ2 and fights him and convinces 
      him that good always triumphs over evil. Vegeta finally realizes and self-destructs 
      in hope to kill Buu. Son Goku than heads to battle against Buu. Son Goku 
      than turns SSJ2,and <img src="images/vegettovbuu.gif" width="140" height="120" align="left">SSJ3! 
      But he still can't defeat Buu. Later, Son Gohan heads to the Kaiosen's planet 
      for training. Then before Son Goku's time is up on Earth he teaches Son 
      Goten and Trunks the fusion technique, then they get trained by Piccolo 
      so they can be strong enough to beat Buu. Soon after Son Goten and Trunks 
      fuse to become Gotenks, later Gotenks turns SSJ1, and then, SSJ3! But Buu 
      has made a twin of himself, but he is a lot more evil than Buu, he even 
      absorbed Buu and thus turning him into Super Buu. Gotenks is defeating Super 
      Buu, but Gotenks is an inexperienced and careless fighter. Buu absorbs Gotenks 
      and becomes a lot stronger, then absorbs Piccolo. Dia Kaoiusin then sacrifices 
      his life so Son Goku can live. Goku then gets a pair of Potara Earrings 
      for fusion, this way the fused person won't diffuse in 30 min. Son Goku 
      now alive teleports to the battle. Then King Yama grants Vegeta life to 
      fight Buu. When Son Goku arrives to the scene he tells Son Gohan to fuse 
      with him, Son Goku than throws a fusion earring at Son Gohan. Son Gohan 
      drops the earring and Buu absorbs Son Gohan, thus turning himself into Ultimate 
      Buu. Then Vegeta comes to the scene. Vegeta then fuses with Son Goku to 
      become, Vegetto. Vegetto defeats Buu but purposely gets absorbed to rescue 
      their friends. This somehow wears off the permanent fusion. They rescue 
      Son Goten, Son Gohan, Trunks, Piccolo, and Fat Buu through Ultimate Buu's 
      pores. All of the energy that Buu has taken restores him back to his normal 
      form, Majin Buu. Then he destroys the Earth. Kaoiu-sin teleports to help 
      Son Goku teleport Vegeta, Satan, his dog, and Dende to Kaoiu-sin's planet. 
      Vegeta gets angry gecause he rescued <img src="images/genkidama.jpg" width="157" height="117" align="left">them 
      instead of his son and the rest of the Z fighters. Son Goku was speechless. 
      But there wasn't any time for that, Majin Buu also teleports to the planet 
      Goku's on, and start to fight. Then Son Goku starts to get beaten up badly. 
      Vegeta jumps into battle so Son Goku can create a Genki-Dami.The Namek DragonBalls 
      are gathered to wish back the Earth and to wish back everyone killed by 
      Buu. The third wish is stored for later use. Son Goku's Genki-Dami (Energy 
      given by the Nameks, the people in the Heavens, and everyone on Earth) is 
      ready to throw, Son Goku throws it, and Buu pushes it back. Vegeta tells 
      Dende to wish back all of Son Goku's strength back. Now with all his strength 
      restored Son Goku, he throws back the Genki- Dami at Buu. Buu can't counter 
      it any longer, so he is killed. Ten years after the battle against Majin 
      Buu, Fat Buu is revived into a evil cleansed form called Uboo. Son Goku 
      decides to train him since he has great potential. Son Gohan and Vidal get 
      married and have a daughter named Pan. This concludes DragonBall Z. </font></td>

      years after the end of DragonBall Z, Son Goku gets turned into a child again 
      by a wish Pilaf made. The only way Son Goku can get back in his normal state

      Pan , and Trunks <img src="images/bebi2.jpg" width="174" height="155" align="right">go 
      on journeys battling minor villans. At one planet, the DragonBall gang stumbles

      but he finally finds the most powerful host, it is Vegeta! Vegeta now turns 
      into Bebi-Vegeta. A great battle between Son Goku and Vegeta begins. It 
      turns out Son Goku is no match for Bebi-Vegeta. Then Kaiousin pulls out 
      Son Goku's tail, hoping he can go into Oozaru stage. It works, but Son Goku 
      still cannot defeat Bebi-Vegeta, who now is Super Bebi (Oozaru Bebi-Vegeta). 
      Then something weird happens, Son Goku takes control of his body now and 
      transforms into SSJ4 Son Goku! Son Goku soon defeats Super Bebi. (Note:

        real Shenlong appears and grants Son Goku one wish, the wish is that everyone 
        killed in battle against the dragons to be brought back to life. Shenlong 
        tells Son Goku to get on his back, then the seven dragonballs are absorbed 
        into Son Goku, and his whole body vanishes, leaving only his clothe on 
        the ground. Seems that Son Goku is the most powerful fighter in the universe
