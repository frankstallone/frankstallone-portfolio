          I have to imit I think Trunks is great, I couldn't find that much on 
          him and I don't know that much about him I still have to watch the episodes 
          he is in, then I will be able to tell more. For now this is what I have....</font></p>
        <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><b>V</b>egeta's and Bulma's son. Appears 
          the first time when coming from the future to warn Gokuu and friends 
          about the coming of Cell and the androids in 3 years (and save Gokuu 
          from dying, who because of the use of teleport has aquired a heart disease. 
          He first appears, when Cyborg Freeza and Great King Cold appear, killing 
          both. He often during the series carries a sword and uses a capsule 
          corp. jacket. We can say that there are two Trunks: The "future" Trunks, 
          who because of his tough life is a lot stronger (in his time he lives 
          in constant fighting so this gives him a lot more training, making him 
          one of the strongest of the series) and also makes him more polite; 
          In his future all of the earth population (including the Z warriors) 
          had been killed by the androids (except for Goku who had died of heart 
          disease provoked by his teleporting tecnique). Hence, Trunks travels 
          20 years back in time to give medicine to Goku and warns the Z warriors 
          about the coming of the androids (he comes back from the future at the 
          same time that Cyborg Freeza and great King Cold appear, killing them 
          both; Trunks knew that by this time, Gokuu would have returned to Earth. 
          Afterwards, Trunks goes back to his own time, but returns again three 
          years later to help the Z fighters battle the Artificial humans. During 
          his stay in the present, he becomes extremely strong, being stronger 
          than any of the Z warriors (excluding Gohan and maybe Goku). After Cell 
          is killed by Gohan, Trunks returns to the future and kills the cyborgs 
          #17, #18 and Cell (in his future #17 and #18 seemed to be stronger), 
          that terrorized his future. The "present" Trunks is not so strong or 
          polite as his future self,- this always gets himself (and his friend 
          Goten) in trouble. During the Z warriors fight against Buu, Trunks fuses 
          with Goten becoming Gotenks, a very powerful character. </font></p>

          Story, this one has a little more to it, since I know Trunks's story 
          can get confusing... I don't fully understand it myself....</font></p>
        <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><b>I</b>n a different timeline... Androids 
          17 and 18 were released. Android 17 killed Dr. Gero and began the androids 
          began their reign of terror. Gokou faced the androids, but suffered 
          a heart attack. Without the proper medicine, Gokou died. Without Gokou, 
          the Z warriors were too weak to stand a chance against the androids. 
          In turn, Vegeta, Yamcha, Tenshin-han, can Klilyn were killed in battle. 
          Chaos wrecked everywhere. Cities were destroyed by the androids just 
          for the fun of it. Many were killed without reason. A few years later... 
          Trunks is now a teenager and Gohan is grown up. Master Roshi, his turtle, 
          and Oolong spent their days hiding in a submarine. Chi-Chi and the Ox-King 
          lived in fear and mourn over Gokou. Bulma learned how to live the terrible 
          environment and goes about his everyday business. Anroids 17 and 18 
          continue to destroy everything in their path. Their victims tried calling 
          the army, but the federal troops have already been killed by the androids. 
          Trunks is riding home with Bulma. There is a radio report about another 
          disaster the androids caused. Trunks becomes angered with rage at such 
          injustice. He flies off to the devastated city and anger continues to 
          build because he knows there is nothing he can do; he knows that he 
          is too weak to fight the androids. Gohan descends in front of Trunks 
          and agrees to train Trunks. The two head back to Bulma's house. Gohan 
          and Trunks spend days in training. Gohan is trying to teach Trunks how 
          to reach Super Saiyan level, but Trunks cannot, despite all his anger. 
          Trunks gets distressed, but Gohan continues to encourage Trun<img src="sstrunks.gif" width="152" height="375" align="right">ks. 
          Meanwhile, Androids 17 and 18 continue their destruction over the world. 
          Gohan and Trunks decide to face the androids. Gohan is standing up against 
          Android 17, but Trunks is getting kicked around by Android 18. Gohan 
          flies over to aid Trunks and has to fight both androids now. The androids 
          throws huge fireballs at Gohan and Trunks and fly away. Gohan wakens 
          and struggles to get his body over to the unconsicous Trunks. Gohan 
          is badly injured and lost an arm in battle. Gohan finally reaches Trunks, 
          struggles to get to his bag of senzu beans, and discovers that there 
          is only one piece left. He feeds it into Trunks' mouth and collapses. 
          Trunks awakens and quickly gets Gohan back to Bulma. Gohan recovers, 
          but is missing a limb now. He continues to train Trunks, but Trunks 
          still cannot reach Super Saiyan level. Days go by, and the androids 
          are still a menace in endangering the Earth. Gohan and Trunks decide 
          to face the androids again. Trunks feels ready to go, but Gohan hits 
          him behind his neck and knocks him out. Gohan knows that Trunks is still 
          not ready, and goes to fight Androids 17 and 18 himself. Trunks awakens 
          and discovered what has happened. He quickly flies over to the city 
          the Androids were in. The city is destroyed, and Gohan is lying on the 
          ground... dead. There is a storm. Rain is falling hard. Trunks looks 
          at the dead Gohan and becomes enraged. He screams and finally reaches 
          Super Saiyan level. Trunks decides to fight the androids again and encounters 
          them. He quickly discovers that even though he is in Super Saiyan form, 
          he is still no match against Androids 17 and 18. The androids kick Trunks 
          around and everything slowly goes blank. Trunks awakens to find himself 
          bandaged in his bed. Bulma had taken his body home. Bulma tells Trunks 
          that she has been working on a time machine and tells Trunks to go back 
          in time to before Gokou got his heart attack. Bulma gives him heart 
          attack medicine for Gokou to prevent his death so that the whole future 
          would change. Trunks agrees. He gets in the time machine capsule that 
          has the word "Hope" painted on it and travels to the past. Bulma waves 
          goodbye and wishes him good luck. Trunks Story ends here, but what happened 
          is told below: Trunks traveled back to where the ending of the Freeza 
          Series took place. He kills Freeza and all of Freeza's crew and introduces 
          himself to the Z warriors. Here is where we first encounter Trunks in 
          the Dragonball Z series. Everything we know of him happens. He gives 
          Gokou the heart attack medicine that Bulma gave him and saves Gokou's 
          life. Then, he trains with Gokou and Vegeta. It is now the Cell Series. 
          Trunks (now known as Future Trunks because the Trunks in the timeline 
          we know of is a baby) joins the struggle against Cell. Cells kills Trunks, 
          but Trunks is resurrected by a wish Dende made for Shenlong. Trunks, 
          now even stronger from all the battles and training, heads back to his 
          time. To his dismay, nothing in the future was changed. However, he 
          is a lot stronger now. He confronts the anroids of his timeline again 
          and easily kills them now. Then, he sees form 1 Cell and easily kills 
          him too. There is peace in his timeline now. </font></p>
