      <td width="65%"><font face="Tahoma" size="2">The Story of Vegeta, the dark 
        prince of the Saiyan came to the series after Radditz was defeated and 
        sent Vegeta the news about the powers of the Dragon Balls. When he arrived 
        on Earth he was accompanied by another saiyan, Nappa, when they arrive 
        Chauzu, Tensin-han and piccolo die trying to defeat Nappa. Then Goku gets 
        back from training, easily defeats Nappa, then Vegeta kills Napa with 
        a single blast. After Nappa dies Goku begins to kick Vegeta around, after 
        Vegeta realizes he cant win in his current stage he creates a Giant energy 
        ball that substitutes the moon, he transforms into his full-moon from 
        (a giant gorilla) ans slaps the remains Z warriors around abit before 
        the of all people the panzey Yajirobe cuts his tail off. While all this 
        is going on Gohan's tail grows back he turns into a giant gorilla and 
        kicks Vegeta around for a while until Vegita cuts his tail off, Gohan 
        lands on Vegeta. Vegeta is tierd and defeated, he crawls to his ship and 
        leaves earth. This is not the end of Vegeta however, he dovotes his life 
        to defeating Goku. in the Buu era he allows Babi-di to turn him into Majin-Vegeta, 
        he allmost defeats Goku, but before he does he realizes that good triumphs 
        over evil and goes after Buu. Later with the help of the Kaiou-shin earring 
        Vegeta and Goku fuse into Vegetto they deafeat buu but porposly gets absorbed, 
        the absorbsion cancelled the affect of the permenant fusion thus, Goku 
        and Vegeta split apart, they find and rescue there friends, but absorbing 
        Vegetto gave Buu enough strenth to complete his phase change and become 
        super buu. after this Buu blows up earth Kaiou-shin teleports then to 
        his planet buu follows they fight buu almost kills goku but Vegeta enters 
        the fight, buu almost kills Vegeta but Satan pops up and threatens buu 
        and buu throws a punch at satan, satan dodges the punch, and buu goes 
        into pain and spits fat buu out the two buu's fight and the good buu gets 
        beat unconscious. Goku and Vegeta start fighting buu again and Vegeta 
        tells Kaiou-shin to gather the Namek balls he does and use two of the 
        three wishes. 1. to restore earth 2. to restore all life lost. the third 
        is saved. now, everyone is on earth exept Goku, Vegeta and Buu. Goku begins 
        to create a Genki Dama while Vegeta distracts Buu. meanwhile the heroes 
        on Earth tell tell everyone to raise there hands to donate energy to Goku's 
        fireball, none listens, but Satan following his example the people of 
        earth raise there hands Goku gets enough energy to fire the Genki-Dama 
        but buu hold the fireball back. So Kaiou-shin makes the last wish and 
        restores Goku's power, with the new power he strenghens the Genki-Dama 
        and Buu cant repel it, thus the end of Dragon Ball Z </font></td>
