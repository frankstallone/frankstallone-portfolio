          future, you must avenge your father's death! Never let the roots of 
          evil disappear!" </font></i></font></p>
        <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><b>W</b>ith these words, Piccolo Daimaou 
          went out in a blaze, his knowledge and memory all transferred to his 
          son, who took on his father's name, Piccolo. Since the moment of his 
          birth, he knew his mission in life. To conquer the world so that chaos 
          and tyranny controls it, and to annihilate the man named Son Gokuu, 
          who was but a boy when he killed Piccolo's father. As such, Piccolo 
          had no childhood. From the moment he was born, he had no one to rely 
          on, thus had to fend for himself in the wilderness, making himself stronger 
          for the eventual day that he would be able to avenge his father's death. 
          It was not a happy time for him, perhaps the reason why he despised 
          Gokuu so. Had it not been for Gokuu, he would have a father whom he 
          could talk to, some companionship for those lonely times he spent in 
          the wilderness. Piccolo's bitterness of the whole situation can be reflected 
          in a statement he made as he threw Gohan into the wilderness to survive 
          without any help: "If you must hate something, then hate your destiny 
          ...which is just like mine." Three years after his birth, he entered 
          the Tenkaichi Budokai under the alias of "Ma Junior," his plan was to 
          first rid himself of Son Gokuu, and then to take over the world, as 
          his father did. Not one to under-estimate Gokuu (like his father did), 
          he was very careful in carrying out his plans. Near the end of the tournament, 
          he thought he had defeated Gokuu, but it turns out that he, too, under-estimated 
          Gokuu just a little bit, and once again suffered defeat. Having been 
          defeated by Gokuu, he expected death, or at least total confinement; 
          but to his surprise, Gokuu gave him a senzu, which restored all his 
          energy. "How dare he take pity on me! I shall make him pay!" must've 
          been the thought that raced through Piccolo's head. Five years later, 
          a new enemy arrived, forcing Piccolo to join forces with Gokuu. Even 
          though the very idea of working with Gokuu made his stomach turn, the 
          situation allowed no other alternative. By the time they finally defeated 
          this new foe, Piccolo had found out the potential Gokuu's son had, and 
          of his usefulness in the upcoming battle, against both the Saiyajins, 
          and possibly Gokuu. As the training with Gohan went on, Piccolo became 
          more and more attached to the lad, even though he didn't want to admit 
          it. However, when he saw that the boy was in danger, he could no longer 
          stand still, and sacrificed himself to save the son of his mortal enemy. 
          This was his true turning point. From this point on, he was no longer 
          Gokuu's rival, but a true ally, even though he still had trouble admitting 
          it to others. In the upcoming fight with Freeza, Piccolo merged with 
          the Namek warrior named Nail, and gained not only power, but knowledge 
          of his true homeworld. Even though Nail promised not to let his own 
          personality be in conflict with Piccolo's, in actuality, the two became 
          more merged than Piccolo had realized. Finally, in the fight against 
          the cyborgs, he decided that his only chance of being able to defeat 
          them was to merge with his father's counterpart. As Piccolo Daimaou 
          was the evil side of Kami-sama, they were essentially the same person, 
          but with completely different personalities. After seeing Cell, Kami-sama 
          decided that it was finally time to allow for the re-merging of the 
          two personalities, changing Piccolo and Kami-sama back to the person 
          they were before the split occurred. The re-merging finally made Piccolo 
          whole, as he should've been. It also gave him the true power that he 
          should have had (actually greater, since he also merged with Nail). 
          As Kuririn said, "If Gokuu is to be considered a Super Saiyajin, then 
          Piccolo must be a Super Namekseijin." Even before re-merging, Piccolo 
          was someone whom the other Z Warriors depended upon. Not only was Piccolo 
          one of the best fighters, he had a great wealth of knowledge and wisdom. 
          In the absense of Gokuu, most of the other Z Warriors looked to Piccolo. 
          After re-merging with Kami-sama, both Piccolo's power and wisdom increased 
          greatly. This was one of the reasons why Majin Buu chose to absorb Piccolo. 
          In the end, Piccolo developed into a very different person from what 
          he started out as. Piccolo chose to stay at Kami-sama's temple, teaching 
          Dende how to be a good Kami-sama, as well as to be out of his previous 
          solitude. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><b>T</b>he original Piccolo Daimaoh comes 
          from the Planet Namek who wanted to become Earth's Kami-sama. To be 
          eligible as Earth's Kami-sama, he had to be pure goodness. So he casts 
          the small evil part of himself out, which became Piccolo Daimaoh. "Piccolo" 
          in Namek means "separate worlds." For this form, we can refer to him 
          as "Piccolo Daimaoh." </font></p>
        <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">After Goku defeated the original Piccolo 
          Daimaoh, Piccolo summoned up his final strength and spat out an egg... 
          an egg which soon hatched a minuature version of himself, with all his 
          memories, thoughts, know- ledge, personality, and physical likeness. 
          This, the son of Piccolo, was essentially Piccolo himself, but in his 
          mind he knew he was not the same person as the original Piccolo, and 
          after fighting with Goku, his personality has been affected by Goku 
          as well. This form can be called Piccolo Jr. or Ma Jr., or simply, Piccolo. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">After sacrificing his own life for Gohan's 
          life, Piccolo was resurrected and placed on his home planet, where he 
          meets a dying Namek warrior, Nail. Nail is surprised at the level of 
          power Piccolo has reached, but knows that even at that level, he is 
          no match for the powerful Freeza, so he offers to be merged with Piccolo. 
          Piccolo reluctantly agrees; although Nail promised to let Piccolo have 
          total control over the body's personality, inevitably Nail's personality 
          still has a strong influence on Piccolo's decisions. For references' 
          sake, if you need to state the specific stage Piccolo is in, you can 
          call this form "Picconailo," but he is still, for the most part, Piccolo, 
          and will go by that name. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">During his fight against the cyborgs, 
          Piccolo realized that he will not be able to defeat the cyborgs by training 
          alone, and the only real way to be close in terms of power is to re-merge 
          with Kami-sama, and in doing so, he has gained the wisdom and knowledge 
          of Kami-sama, as well as some of the personality aspects of Kami-sama. 
          Again, for reference, you may call this form "Kamiconailo" or even "Kamicolo," 
          but he is still essentially Piccolo, as still goes by that name. </font></p>
