      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Well well well. I 
        don't see why you want to know about my life but since you asked I will 
        tell you a little about me, my favorite things, and somethings I don't 
        like. Of course I would also like to say that if I say anything that may 
        be taken offensivly please don't, I know their are a lot of people out 
        their looking for something to try to take peoples websites. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Okay so about me, 
        I am 15 years old, I have a pic but it is to old to put up so I am not 
        sure you are going to see it anytime soon. I live in a small town called 
        South Bound Brook, in New Jersey. I goto Bound Brook High, because my 
        town is to small for a high school. We are lucky we have a middle school 
        and I am not even sure how much longer that is going to last. As of now 
        and as far back as I can remember (tells you about my memory hint hint) 
        I have been going out with a sweet girl. I love her a lot, her name is 
        Emily. Hmm lets see here, I am usually on America Online a lot, my screen 
        name is my E-Mail address pertaining to that, I also go on IRC, or Internet 
        Relay Chat. I am usually in the channels of #wired, and #DBZ. Oh yeah 
        if you didn't know yet I am in love with the cartoon Dragonball Z. You 
        may, ot may not have heard of it from Cartoon Network. I was bored one 
        day and said wait they had to have made more then what they show on Cartoon 
        network and I found out that you miss a lot. I like Dragonball Z so much 
        mostly because it has a backround to it, not something stupid. But I am 
        sure you are not interested.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">If I haven't put you 
        to sleep yet I shall tell you about my all time favorite movie. That is 
        Back to the Future. I never knew why I was so attracked to me movie but 
        I do know (remember) that when I was a kid and I was off from school and 
        sick they would sit me in front of the TV and I would watch Back to the 
        Future over and over and over. I guess it just stuck with me. So did the 
        car. I would do anything to get a hold of a DeLorean. I heard John DeLorean 
        got another grant to make cars again, I hope he does, I like his designs, 
        it's to bad he did what he did to screw up his company. At the bottom 
        is a picture of the car that I found from someone who has an replica of 
        the car from the movie!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Music preferences... 
        That comes to and interesting topic to some people because usually it's 
        eighter Rap or Alternative. Well I happen to like both, my dad is a DJ 
        so I listen to just about anything that will play and has a good beat. 
        I love rap beats but some of the lyrics I don't care for. Alternative 
        is okay. I have the covers of 2 of my favorite CD's this proves that I 
        have a wide range of musical belief down at the bottom.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Okay well as I said 
        I goto Bound Brook High School. I am in most of the Academic classes, 
        I know for a fact I am not honor material. I play tennis, no I am not 
        a dork but it is something better then going home everyday after school 
        and sitting on my a$$. I am going to try to get into the Robotics for 
        school for animation. I assume my graphics are good for something. I am 
        hoping I can do something for the team, we won #1 in Florida last year 
        for animation. Thats cool so I am definatly going to give it a try. I 
        am in Latin II, I suggest you try at least Latin I I didn't notice how 
        much your vocabulary changes for the better when you take that class. 
        Of course last year I totally wasn't paying attention and I can feel how 
        that is slowing me down now. That is okay though I can deal with it.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Another thing about 
        me is that I like to ride freestyle BMX. I ride with Jeremy and Chi, and 
        whoever else is around. My bike happens to be really expensive, it cost 
        me around $900 - $1000. It is a Standard Shorty. I made and old old page 
        on the bike with pics but I'd have to totally remake the site I don't 
        want to be imbarrised and show you that, but all the way at the bottom 
        of this page is a pic of my bike. Sometime soon I will make you able to 
        click these images into a pop up with the fullsized image, but for now 
        I shunk them to fit your screen. Here are the spcs for my bike...</font></p>
