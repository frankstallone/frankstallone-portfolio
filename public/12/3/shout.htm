            where you get spot out. I just threw a couple names out in here but
            this will grow, if you are not on here and think you should be IM
            me and complain, but don't bother me if I am doing something important.
            heh. Well I don't have much to say about this page, basically the
            name/handle of the person is to the right and the table splits to
            the lef in which I have written why I think they should be in this
            shout outz.<br>
            Hint: If you go over a name/handle that lights up, it goes to their
            webpage. If indeed they do have a webpage their name (with your mouse
            not on it) will be a darker green until ur mouse, goes over the text.
            That was confusing me. =)</font></p>

        I heard was leaving AOL which is the main ISP I use to talk to most of
        the people I have here, which is not good unless he is going to IRC or
        ICQ where I can still talk to him. In any event he is here because as
        far as I know I am not on his shout outz, on his page. =P So I thought
        it would be nice to include him.</font></td>

          lol. He is cool, he makes art, as do I and I am in his group, for grafics.
          I made him an image that you can access by going to the art section
          or by <a href="art.htm">Clicking Here</a>. I like smaka because he always
          has his opinions and is not afraid to tell you what they are, but constructive
          of course!! He has a page and is working on a new one for the group.
          I will tell you more about that later.</font></p>

        can I say about fo0l, besides the fact that he is one. Nah, fo0l is cool
        when I first met him we talked very little but I knew he was old skewl
        and that I could trust him so we got into a mini &lt;&gt;&lt; buiness.
        (If you don't know what it is don't bother asking I don't feel like answering!)
        He has a webpage I think, yeah I saw it for the first time the other day
        I remember now. The only thing I don't like is that he modified my screen
        name on his account &quot;Iazy ass phunky@aol.com&quot; so that I could
        not receive attachments... grrr. I am not a kid you know!</font></td>

        and fo0l have webpages, when I get the URL's I will link them here. They
