        I have been working on art for about a year now. I am okay at graphics 
        but I have to say that what I have seen out there is something I long 
        to be able to do. I am currently learinging how to use Flash 4 with my 
        friend Jake, and I am sure we are going to come up with something amazing 
        soon so keep your eye out for this.</font> 
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">I broke 
          this section up into two sections as of now. One section is for my older 
          art (Which right now has a lot more than my new section, school might 
          have something to do with the exportation of art lately), that has been 
          like last summer, and a little from the beggining of the year. Some 
          of it may be primative but hey, we all start somwhere. </font>
