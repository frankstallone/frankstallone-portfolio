              Shakespeare's play Hamlet, is one of the greatest plays ever written. 
              With the advent of the film industry, the classics were perfect 
              targets for this new entertainment media. However, movies do not 
              allow the viewer to develop an opinion that is more their own than 
              if they had read the book.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing and reading Hamlet, 
              it appeared that Hamlet did not desire his mother in a sexual way. 
              He just appeared to have a soft spot in his heart for his mother. 
              However, after Mel Gibson's portrayal of Hamlet, Hamlet's desire 
              for Gertrude was almost undeniable. The scene with Hamlet on top 
              of Gertrude made Hamlet seem like he was on the verge of being a 
              rapist (however, that would only be true if Gertrude did not seem 
              to be consenting to this act, but that is another issue). The play 
              allows for the viewer to come to his or her own conclusion, the 
              movie made the viewer see the director's opinion on Hamlet's problem. 
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of Hamlet's insanity 
              was also less up to the viewer in the movie than in the play. Scenes 
              where Hamlet was lurking in the shadows were shown in the movie 
              rather than assumed as in the play. Hamlet was in ramparts lurking 
              around in the movie, but in the play, one assumed this, or did not 
              assume this, depending on their viewpoint on Hamlet's sanity. The 
              movie showed Hamlet as sane, feigning insanity. The play left it 
              up to the reader to decide.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the movie was excellently done, 
              the movie took away the viewer's chance for choice. The viewer saw 
              the director's view, not their own, however, that is the type of 
              freedom one gives up when viewing movies. Mel Gibson portrayed Hamlet 
              perfectly. He was able to go from sane to insane in a heartbeat; 
              much like the Hamlet of the play is able to do. The play is always 
              going to be better than any movie, but Mel Gibson in Hamlet was 
              a very good jab at Hamlet.</font></p>
