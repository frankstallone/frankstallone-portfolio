            <p align="left"> <i>Hamlet</i> is one of the greatest plays ever. 
              The greatest part of the play is the mystery of Hamlet's sanity. 
              Hamlet fools every character in the play, even his own mother. Hamlet 
              uses this trickery to his advantage. With all the characters believing 
              Hamlet is crazy, he is free to do whatever he wants. He sets up 
              his plan to topple the king without any meddling from the other 
              characters. However, in feigning this insanity, does Hamlet actually 
              go insane? The simple answer to this is no. Hamlet maintains his 
              sanity from beginning to end. He knows what he is doing the whole 
              time. The only instance where it is arguable that he does go insane 
              is in the actually committing of the killing of Claudius. Hamlet, 
              during the whole play, is an indecisive person. The act of murder 
              is completely out of reach for Hamlet. Hamlet did not even kill 
              himself; he argues that it is against his religion, it would not 
              help his father's soul go to heaven, or it would send Claudius to 
              heaven. Hamlet always has an excuse for not killing Claudius when 
              he has the chance. The fact that Hamlet does kill Claudius in the 
              end proves that Hamlet has gone through some type of mental change. 
              However, this mental change is maturity. Hamlet, at the start of 
              the play is about 18. By the end of the play, Hamlet is around 35+ 
              years old. During this time, Hamlet has to grow and change. Unfortunately 
              for Hamlet, he does not mature in one mental façade in which he 
              needs to; the Oedipus Complex. Hamlet still has an unhealthy love/want 
              for his mother. This is what motivates him in the end to kill Claudius. 
              With his mother poisoned in the end by Claudius, Hamlet becomes 
              enraged and must kill Claudius. Hamlet kills Claudius for his mother. 
              While he will tell the world, and have Horatio tell the world, he 
              killed Claudius to avenge his father; his true reason for killing 
              Claudius is for his mother. This is because the latter reason is 
              not socially accepted, and therefore cannot be accepted by Hamlet. 
              Hamlet is a product of his society, what the society feels is right 
              and fair is what Hamlet feels is right and fair. This is what motivates 
              Hamlet, not insanity. With such a complex character like Hamlet, 
              this play could not become anything but a classic.</p>
