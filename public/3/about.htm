      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Well
        well well. I don't see why you want to know about my life but since you
        asked I will tell you a little about me, my favorite things, and somethings
        I don't like. Of course I would also like to say that if I say anything
        that may be taken offensivly please don't, I know their are a lot of people
        out their looking for something to try to take peoples websites. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Okay
        so about me, I am 15 years old, I have a pic but it is to old to put up
        so I am not sure you are going to see it anytime soon. I live in a small
        town called South Bound Brook, in New Jersey. I goto Bound Brook High,
        because my town is to small for a high school. We are lucky we have a
        middle school and I am not even sure how much longer that is going to
        last. As of now and as far back as I can remember (tells you about my
        memory hint hint) I have been going out with a sweet girl. I love her
        a lot, her name is Emily. Hmm lets see here, I am usually on America Online
        a lot, my screen name is my E-Mail address pertaining to that, I also
        go on IRC, or Internet Relay Chat. I am usually in the channels of #wired,
        and #DBZ. Oh yeah if you didn't know yet I am in love with the cartoon
        Dragonball Z. You may, ot may not have heard of it from Cartoon Network.
        I was bored one day and said wait they had to have made more then what
        they show on Cartoon network and I found out that you miss a lot. I like
        Dragonball Z so much mostly because it has a backround to it, not something
        stupid. But I am sure you are not interested.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">If I
        haven't put you to sleep yet I shall tell you about my all time favorite
        movie. That is Back to the Future. I never knew why I was so attracked
        to me movie but I do know (remember) that when I was a kid and I was off
        from school and sick they would sit me in front of the TV and I would
        watch Back to the Future over and over and over. I guess it just stuck
        with me. So did the car. I would do anything to get a hold of a DeLorean.
        I heard John DeLorean got another grant to make cars again, I hope he
        does, I like his designs, it's to bad he did what he did to screw up his
        company. At the bottom is a picture of the car that I found from someone
        who has an replica of the car from the movie!</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Music
        preferences... That comes to and interesting topic to some people because
        usually it's eighter Rap or Alternative. Well I happen to like both, my
        dad is a DJ so I listen to just about anything that will play and has
        a good beat. I love rap beats but some of the lyrics I don't care for.
        Alternative is okay. I have the covers of 2 of my favorite CD's this proves
        that I have a wide range of musical belief down at the bottom.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Okay
        well as I said I goto Bound Brook High School. I am in most of the Academic
        classes, I know for a fact I am not honor material. I play tennis, no
        I am not a dork but it is something better then going home everyday after
        school and sitting on my a$$. I am going to try to get into the Robotics
        for school for animation. I assume my graphics are good for something.
        I am hoping I can do something for the team, we won #1 in Florida last
        year for animation. Thats cool so I am definatly going to give it a try.
        I am in Latin II, I suggest you try at least Latin I I didn't notice how
        much your vocabulary changes for the better when you take that class.
        Of course last year I totally wasn't paying attention and I can feel how
        that is slowing me down now. That is okay though I can deal with it.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Another
        thing about me is that I like to ride freestyle BMX. I ride with Jeremy
        and Chi, and whoever else is around. My bike happens to be really expensive,
        it cost me around $900 - $1000. It is a Standard Shorty. I made and old
        old page on the bike with pics but I'd have to totally remake the site
        I don't want to be imbarrised and show you that, but all the way at the
        bottom of this page is a pic of my bike. Sometime soon I will make you
        able to click these images into a pop up with the fullsized image, but
        for now I shunk them to fit your screen. Here are the spcs for my bike...</font></p>
