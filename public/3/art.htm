    of the art I have made so far in my life that I think you should want to see.
    It's not really that much but I am working on that. Some of the images here
    are to big to fit so you can accually click on them to make them bigger, it
    will open another window to show it in. If you can not click on the image
    do not get distraught, it is at its max viewable already.</font></p>

            I was playing around out of no where I came up with this to show you
            just expactly how good I am. =) Okay so I was joking. This is just

            - This guy was the lucky winner of a &quot;lottery drawing I had in
            a chat room&quot;. Well thats what I called it anyway. It was about
            10 at night, I was bored, I was like, I wanna do art, but who for.
            I didn't much care I just wanted it for the experiance. Anyway I was
            in the private room art (which is dieing with lamers lately) and was
            like, &quot;The first person to IM me gets free art done for their
            site, order now, limited time only, act now, blah blah&quot;. I tell
            ya, I got so many IMs my PC was half frozen (the other half was reading
            the differenct fonts). In any event Mr. Skoobie </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">DoO
            won. So this is what I made for him. (Hint: I may do that again so
            be ready for it in that room, if you goto that room!) =P</font></p>

            LoL I LOVE THIS! Sorry I like this image a lot, if you can not tell
            what this is a take off from, then you are not a teen in this world.
            I think I am going to try too keep doing things like this, trying
            to make my own art out of something I think should have more to it.
            I love this, again, I would give this a 10.5!</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"></font></p>
