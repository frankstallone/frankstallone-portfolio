        suggestion is to start off a dirt jumper early in ur freestyle years,
        IF you wanna be good at half pipes and ramps. You learn many tricks in
        the air which is something not easily done. <b><font color="#99FF99">&gt;</font></b>
        These frames/bikes are usually thiner then Street bikes but the sizing
        range from '19 - '21. The reason they can be thinner is because when you
        are trying to jump a good 10 - 20 foot gap in the dirt, lighter may get
        you across a little safer, and without having to look like Steve Austin.</font></td>

        yes, good old ramps. If you don't know half pipes, quarter pipes, and
        plain old ramps fall into this catagory, I think I made this catigory
        up its more like street, but you don't find a half pipe anywhere in the
        streets so I'd figure, why not confuse you and make another section! <b><font color="#99FF99">&gt;</font></b>
        Heh, these frames/bikes are usually 19' - 20' top tubes, because it is
        said that they carry better in the air then a flatland bike/frame.</font></td>

          For Flatland the ideal bike was revolved around the bike I have currently
          but thier have been versions of this bike that other companys make to
          this day,<b> <font color="#99FF99">Rigid </font></b>I happen to have
          heard is one of the best flatland bikes out their, word by pro riders
          that is, mostly because everything is where it should be for clearance.<br>
          This frame is compliments of Chris, of <a href="mailto:Temposs1@aol.com">Temposs1@aol.com</a>
          this frame is slightly modified, he took off the standing platform.
          He did an awsome job with that modification, you can't even tell that
          it was even their.</font></div>

          that you could use it for street and ramps. I am personally thinking
          about envesting in this bike frame, the newest version just seems so
          awsome and is what I need right now, or is what I think I want anyway.</font></div>

          Now, don't get me wrong about any of this I wanna get a Chris Bennet
          Frame for ramps so this is not what you should get and its not the only
          thing you can do with the bikes. Mind you again I own a flatland frame
          and I jump ramps %90 of the time. In my opinion the ideal ramp frame/bike
          would have to be... The <font color="#99FF99">Standard S T A (Stronger
          Than All)</font>. This frame I wanted for some time, well I wanted a
          lot of frames this is one of the top 5 though for sure, Bennet being
          #1. This frame is the original and the greatest, I don't know much of
          what else to say except sorry for such a small pic, I will try to get
          a better one soon.</font></div>
