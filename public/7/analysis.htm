            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><b><i>Anger, 
              Sloth</i> Prince Hamlet:</b> Although many believe Hamlet to be 
              severely disturbed, we believe that Hamlet is quite the contrary. 
              He is a boy at heart, with the mind of a philosopher. Young Hamlet 
              lacks the gut necessary to carry out all the things he talks about 
              doing. One thing that the entire play deals with is Hamlet's inability 
              to respect himself in his inability to carry out what he truly wants 
              to do because he feels morally it is wrong. Could it be that Hamlet 
              is too morally correct in his inability to avenge his father's murder? 
              Or could it be that Hamlet acts as anyone of us would act now. Hamlet 
              is not a character to be questioned, but a reality that does not 
              require it. We are Hamlet, and it is possible that this is truly 
              what Shakespeare wanted us to realize.</font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><i><b>Lust</b></i>: 
              The Queen's Motivation: Men, brother in law, son, and sex? What 
              is up with this lady? Her husband is so forgottenly murdered that 
              she marries his own brother. She loves her son and lives for him 
              but in some people's eyes she feels things for him (you know, raw, 
              down and dirty feelings!). Truly Gertrude is a nauseating character 
              while she lives up to Hamlets ideas about women. She is just like 
              naive Ophelia in that but this woman is severely disturbed, and 
              in that it is she that should have her sanity questioned. </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><b><i>Envy, 
              Lust</i></b> Claudius or shall we call him "funkle"? This man, is 
              a man completely opposite in morals than those followed by Hamlet. 
              He is in, shall we say, a completely different universe in comparison 
              to the morals of Hamlet. As Hamlet is completely indecisive and 
              unable to follow through with the majority of his ideas, his "funkle" 
              is a man, able to murder his own brother, take his crown and throne, 
              attempt to murder his own nephew, while living a completely incestuous 
              relationship with his sister-in-law. He definitely takes on the 
              role of the bad guy in Hamlet in all of these actions, while it 
              seems as though the remorse felt by him is little in his inability 
              to ask for God's forgiveness and pardon (he knows he would have 
              probably done it all again). This king comes to a well-deserved 
              end, filled with poison as lethal as cyanide, and a vacation to 
              Hell.</font></p>
            <p align="center"><img src="Opheliac.jpg" width="263" height="195"></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><b><i>Carelessness</i></b> 
              Poor sweet Ophelia, a character scarred by her own weakness and 
              frailty. In mind and body Ophelia was soft. She allowed for Hamlet 
              to take her virginity, she succumbed to the beckoning call of the 
              King and Queen to betray her only Love, and she lost her sanity 
              when her sponge-like father Polonious was killed by Hamlet. Ophelia's 
              weakness supported greatly Hamlet's comment on women, "Frailty, 
              thy name is woman." </font></p>
            <p align="center"><img src="CLAUDIUSANDOPHELIAANDPOLONIUSc.jpg" width="263" height="193"></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><b><i>Gluttony</i></b> 
              Polonius is a sponge. Driven by his own need for power, Polonius 
              is like a sponge for words. Using his great ability as a spy (so 
              great that he sneezed his way to hell) and as an advisor to the 
              king he thinks he will know all and therefor have all. He, like 
              Hamlet, respects knowledge; as they felt the mind to be the only 
              weapon needed to win in life. But to what he uses the knowledge 
              for shows his overwhelming flaw of greed for knowledge and power. 
              This greed eventually means Polonius' death.</font></p>
            <p align="center"><img src="ply_hmbk.jpg" width="263" height="197"></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><b><i>Perfect 
              </i></b>-Horatio is a good man in every aspect. He is the only character 
              unable to be bought by the King, and the only character given full 
              trust by Hamlet. He remains Hamlet's best friend from the beginning 
              till the end of the play, never doubting Hamlet's mind, actions, 
              or character. Horatio is a man who deserves the utmost respect and 
              admiration of any reader of Shakespeare's Hamlet, for his honor, 
              for his trust in Hamlet, and for his love for Hamlet. Horatio would 
              have killed himself along his friend Hamlet not because he was a 
              lapdog, but because his existence was dedicated to Hamlet and he 
              felt empty without a friend who could trust him the way Hamlet did.</font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Pride Laertes 
              is a man both honorable and noble deep down; while on the surface 
              appears to be a gullible puppet of the King. He is responsible for 
              both his and Hamlet's undoing, in his use of a poison dipped sword. 
              Too overcome with grief for the losses of his sister and father, 
              he sees only Hamlet's guilt in these deaths and looks beyond reasoning. 
              For this he is more like Fortinbraus, another man able to act in 
              the honor of his father while putting aside morals like those of 
              Hamlet. Laertes only strays from goodness in these moments, but 
              in his true honor and nobility, realizes his mistake and makes amends 
              with the young Hamlet. Laertes is a man, rash but real, and in his 
              hasty mistakes he holds many qualities we all show in our day to 
              day lives.</font></p>

              by his son. Put through the anguish of Hell, and the deceit of his 
              incestuous wife/sister in law. </font></p>
