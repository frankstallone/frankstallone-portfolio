            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I like Shakespeare. 
              His work seems to agree with me. I understand the way he writes, 
              and after four years of reading his work, I've learned to appreciate 
              it. Hamlet is no exception, the plot is quite entriguing. As true 
              with all Shakespeare's work, the ending is always the final draw 
              for all the main characters. I thought that the ending was executed 
              extremely nicely. I was excited to find out how all of the main 
              characters were going to perish. They all managed to die without 
              any other outside involvement. The other main idea presented in 
              Hamlet is the question of Hamlet's sanity. Hamlet is not crazy. 
              Hamlet has personality traits that help define a psychotic person, 
              but he is not crazy. Other than that, I really enjoyed the play.</font></p>
