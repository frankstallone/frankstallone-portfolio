            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Let's see. To 
              start things off I just want to say that I dislike Shakespeare in 
              general. Maybe this is because of the way that it has been presented 
              to me or maybe I just do not care for the way that he writes. This, 
              however is not the case with this play. For once I can actually 
              say that I enjoyed something that Shakespeare wrote. I think that 
              this is because of the way that it was taught to me. I usually find 
              Shakespeare's works to very boring and drab, but this time I was 
              able to get into the play and analyze the characters. I have come 
              to the conclusion that Hamlet was the least of the insane of all 
              the characters. On the other hand the most insane character in the 
              entire play was Claudius. All of the other characters were not necessarily 
              insane but rather disturbed in their own way. Hamlet was the smartest 
              of all the characters. He was able to play with people's minds in 
              order to find out what they were thinking and planning. Throughout 
              the entire play Hamlet was able to know what people had in store 
              for him. Hamlet knew what Claudius, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, 
              Laertes, and Polonius had planned for him and what they were trying 
              to do with him. Hamlet was always skillful enough to find out, through 
              his wit and cunning attitude, what people were thinking. Because 
              Hamlet was able to see his father's ghost does not mean that he 
              was crazy or insane. Rather, it means that he had the introspective 
              mind that nobody else in play had and was able to realize and see 
              things that only the most intelligent of people could see. Ophelia, 
              On the other hand, was going off the deep end from the start of 
              the play. She was crazy from the beginning. This was all proven 
              when her father was murdered. It is at this point that Ophelia really 
              shows the reader that she is wacked out. She begins to sing and 
              hand out "flowers" which are actually bones. I mean she winds up 
              dying because she drowned in a brook, the most shallow of all bodies 
              of water except for maybe a puddle. All these things prove that 
              she was a little bit out there. All of the other characters were 
              crazy in their own way. They all had something that made them a 
              little bit strange or delirious. I mean how could someone not be 
              if they married their brother's wife after murdering him or taking 
              bribes in order to spy on their best friend. They only character 
              besides Hamlet that was not insane would be Horatio. He was always 
              there for Hamlet. He never tried to plot anything against anyone 
              and was nothing but a good friend. So this is what I thought of 
              the play. It is not the most in depth critique but it is rather 
              just the way that I felt after reading and analyzing it. </font></p>
