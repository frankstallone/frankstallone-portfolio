            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hamlet in my 
              eyes is one of the best plays I have ever read. The movie does the 
              book no harm, and even accentuates the supreme quality of Shakespeare 
              and his writing mind. After my ear became accustomed to hearing 
              Shakespeare's older style of writing the words echoed through my 
              mind like a voice screaming inside of a large hollow cavern. I can 
              still remember his words from Romeo and Juliet, so romantic, "tis 
              the lark, the herald of the mor n;" but his overtones in Hamlet 
              excite me; death, deception, incest, sexual feeling, action, excitement, 
              and murder. What more could any teenager want in a movie or more 
              rarely read books in this modern era. I must say that it was the 
              ending that really enticed me and made this play a hit. It wasn't 
              the kind of happy ending we are used to seeing. It was religiously 
              ended happily. Hamlet went to Heaven, and his foes went to hell. 
              They got their just punishments in the end, and Hamlet completed 
              his weighty task. Shakespeare's Hamlet is a story so well written 
              that the classic invocation of the gods could not even come close 
              to the writings done after the invocation of Shakespeare's guidance. 
              Jake and Dweebert give this play two thumbs up! </font></p>
