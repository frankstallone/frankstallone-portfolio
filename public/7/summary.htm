          <div align="left">
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">King Hamlet 
              is dead. His ghost is making house calls. Gerturde is sleeping with 
              his brother in law Claudius. A week after The King dies, shes married 
              to Claudius. Ophelia is becoming delusional, and her sex life isn't 
              improving either. And in the midst of it all, lies Prince Hamlet. 
              None of his actions are without foresight, except for the death 
              of poor innocent Polonius. Hamlet felt absolutely mortified about 
              the death of Polonius. Hamlet is so smart he confuses even his own 
              conscious when it comes to Ophelia. Hamlet's relationship with Ophelia 
              is going straight to hell, she's becoming quite the out-patient. 
              The brook got the best of her. She never had a chance. Hamlet becomes 
              a promising playwright, his target audience was definitely affected 
              by his work. Claudius never saw it coming. Even though Hamlet's 
              vengeance is strong, he restrains himself from disgracing the church, 
              and his ticket to the good place. King Hamlet's ghost has got Hamlet 
              dancing on his finger, Hamlet fulfills his father's wishes, but 
              not without side effects. Hamlet's ending holds true to the Shakespearean 
              form when all the main characters perish in an extravagant show 
              of deceit. Laertes is on an ego based power trip demanding the throne 
              from Claudius. Laertes, having a weak mind, is pulled in by Claudius's 
              smooth talking. Its too bad Claudius's smooth talking stabs him 
              in the gut and tears out his insides. Having repented, Laertes is 
              on his way to heaven with Gertrude. Gertrude perishes by Claudius's 
              clever hand, the pearl meant for Hamlet was the culprit. Hamlet 
              is dead, alas, and Horatio wants to go with him. The sweet prince 
              denies him this opportunity, and turns all the lands owned by his 
              father over to who else but good old Fortinbras. Fortinbras, a noble 
              leader, ends the play with a powerful line, stating his belief in 
              Hamlet's cleverness and his potential ability to rule as King.</font>
