              AHH!! I thought I had lost this site for good. For a month my login 
              to the FTP wasn't working, and i couldn't get ahold of anyone to 
              help me out with my situation. Finally one day Dejen reappeared 
              and granted me access once again! Well its about time I changed 
              the band of the month, from Funeral for a Friend to none other then 
              the band that should be put on the spot. Armor for Sleep. Possibly 
              my personally favorite CD of the year, thats right as soon as the 
              third month into the new year. Their new CD has more potention then 
              an atom bomb going towards the orient. They're sound explodes around 
              you and feels like a warm blanket right out of the dryer. I'll let 
              nailedshut.com take this situation under control. I've seen these 
              guys once at a glassjaw show last year. If you get a chance check 
              out their new album. ASAP.<em>&gt;deviant-terrace</em> </p>
            <p><strong>Feb.9.03 :: </strong>Haha, today was a very interesting 
              day. My birthday party *for the family* at my sisters house. Even 
              my mom showed up wtih her boyfriend Dino. It was quite interesting 
              to see so much of my family in one place at one time. My great aunt 
              forgot to get me a card this year, but I forgive her because she 
              is going to be 86 soon! God bless her. haha. I can't stop laughing 
              theres just too much to say. My sister bought me a beer can... She 
              said it was no ordinary beer can though. I opened up the fridge 
              and there sat what looked like a mini keg. I was like oooooooooo 
              yea! I can't wait until I am 21. =) Alright, thats all I have to 
              say today. <em>&gt;deviant-terrace.</em></p>
            <p><strong>Feb.5.2003 :: </strong>Today the photoshop page completes 
              the site. Now to start making more deviations! <em>&gt;deviant-terrace</em> 
            </p>
            <p><strong>Feb.4.2003 ::</strong> Today I started early. The wallpaper 
              and photographing and link pages are now up. I set those up a little 
              different this time. More to come soon! &gt;<em>-deviant terrace. 
              </em></p>
                <p><span class="bld">Feb.1.2003 ::</span> Welp, this project is 
                  underway finally! If you want to know where I am going with 
                  the idea for this page its quite simple. I am bringing php 101 
                  into this design along with trying to make images that are more 
                  respectable to those on 56k modems still. Broadband isn't available 
                  everywhere, nor does everybody have that kind of money for the 
                  internet. So the internet has to be there for them! <br>
                  Expect all the same things from my last page, I will keep everyone 
                  updated with new images I have made exc. I really need to find 
                  out some new techniques, I feel rusty in the html markup world. 
                  <br>
                  So please, have a seat, stay a while, or leave me a comment!

            Armor for Sleep, a band that has the instrumental sound of Thursday 
            and lyrics which follow suit to that of Park have released their debut 
            album entitled, &quot;Things That Disappear.&quot; This album is all 
            about struggles and loses. The band itself is rather young, almost 
            all of them 18 years old, so with time they will mature and so will 
            their music. For a debut album these guys have a head start on most 
            of the competition. I haven't heard such a good debut album since 
            Open Hand, and believe me when I tell you this CD will have something 
            for everyone to relate to. The album will put you into a trance. I 
            believe these guys have a lot of potential. I listen to it all the 
            time, and enjoy the clean guitar and smooth sound of the vocals. Check 
            it out!
