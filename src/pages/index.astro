        <p>Through discovery sessions, customer and client interviews, industry research with a small team we rebranded Ashmore Partners to Builders Trust Capital. This shift signified the next step in the journey of the partnersa and company. They wanted to show their clients and investors that they were in this for the long haul.

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-snug font-bold font-now pb-4">Prototyped and built chat bot conversation, timeline and people user interfaces that allowed business owners, and HCM practitioners to accomplish their daily activities faster and with confidence.</p>
        <p>Collaborated with business, design team and backend developers using data from research and user usage I helped clean up the information architecture, came up with UX optimizations to be proactive for the user and simplify hierarchy with methodologies like progressive disclosure. From there I refined the UI creating new design patterns, created a dynamic design token solution and integrated with the team in our component library built with React. Learn, educate, refine, rinse and repeat with an amazing team.</p>
