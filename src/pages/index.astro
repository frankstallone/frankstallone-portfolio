      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-snug font-semibold font-future pb-4">Prototyped and built chat bot conversation, timeline and people user interfaces that allowed business owners, and HCM practitioners to accomplish their daily activities faster and with confidence.</p>
      <p>Collaborated with business, design team and backend developers using data from research and user usage I helped clean up the information architecture, came up with UX optimizations to be proactive for the user and simplify hierarchy with methodologies like progressive disclosure. From there I refined the UI creating new design patterns, created a dynamic design token solution and integrated with the team in our component library built with React. Learn, educate, refine, rinse and repeat with an amazing team.</p>
