        Roll by ADP is a self service app that allows business owners to run
        payroll and manage <abbr title="Human Capital Management">HCM</abbr> through
        a chat bot with a sophisticated suite of <abbr title="Machine Learning"
          >ML</abbr
        > algorithms and <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr>. Our
        workflow engine is based on event sourcing which captures actions and
        stores it in sequence. We apply this to a few user interfaces on mobile
        devices and desktop.

      <p class="lg:text-lg">
        There are a wide array of attributes that can be applied to a manager or
        employee. They can be mixed and matched depending on the company,
        location and organization structure. What payment method do we use for
        our employees? Did they get a mid-cycle rise? How many hours did they
        work? Did they have overtime or sick time?

      We begin with discovery. I start by asking a few questions about the vast
      array of attributes any one employee can have associated with them. This
      quickly gets out of hand as there are many. We now know there needs to be
      a <abbr title="Minimum Viable Product">MVP</abbr> that we can ship first and
      that we should focus on that today. To figure this out we write down all of
      the payroll workflows we have to design for and pick one.
    </p>
    <p class="lg:text-lg">
      We have decided to scope this discussion to a single payroll flow, a
      manager whose managing his employee's hours. Focusing on this flow will
      set the stage for what the UX and UI will look like, then we can come back
      and pressure test the design to see if it will solve our other payroll
      flows.

        >s. It's becoming clear some of these attributes are not needed. This
        will be a list of employees for the manager to quickly scroll through,
        add hours in an input field and submit payroll. We want minimal friction
        and the least amount of cognitive load on these managers as possible.

        I start to see how an accordion design pattern could solve this. I know
        this design pattern can also be highly accessible. I proceed to draw out
        an example on the whiteboard explaining how an accordion works and how
        it can solve the business problem. This affords us the ability to hide
        attributes that are less common like overtime, bonus and payment type.
      </p>
      <p class="lg:text-lg">
        Everyone is in agreement. Now, we sit and talk about the hierarchy of
        the main attributes. Marking the whiteboard I'm educating the team on
        the importance of visual hierarchy. I'm also pressing them on being
        judicious about what becomes a main attribute to keep down the potential
        for cognitive overload. Finally we have a wireframe everyone is happy
        with. Before I move to building high fidelity mockups we discuss a few
        more use payroll flows. It passes the pressure test. Now I move to
        higher fidelity mockups with real data that we can use to discuss the
        visual hierarchy in more detail.

        We need to consider edge cases and it helps to push the design limits
        with real names, numbers and data. Hopping into Affinity Designer at the
        time but Figma today I layout the accordion panels. I design an area to
        signal to users that there is 'more' they can do lay out the main
        attributes. I am talking to the backend developers clarifying data
        structures and thinking about how I'll be able to make these panel
        layouts pliable with flexbox. Working with the SME's I'm looking for
        ways to break this design with graceful fallbacks. How any decimal
        places will we encounter? What are the different pay cycles? What will
        we do when we're out of room when translated to German? I consider
        color, contrast ratios font size for readability and accessibility.
        Next, I bring in the supplementary attributes on the expanded panel
        portion of the accordion. We strip out any unnecessary design elements
        that do not serve a purpose. This keeps the user on task, focused.

        Finally, we have an approved suite of mockups. Time to move to our
        component library. I fire up Storybook and start building out the
        compound React components. We're using flexbox to layout the panel rows
        and columns within. I collaborate with the backend engineer about data
        structures to ensure the API is flexible.
      </p>
      <p class="lg:text-lg mb-4">
        There are a couple pitfalls of using flexbox and compound React
        components. The main one is that the backend engineer has more control
        over layout of the rows and their column alignment. CSS grid would solve
        this but technically is not applicable to this situation. Restricting
        the layout to only props for the front-end to style would stifle
        progress.
      </p>
      <p class="lg:text-lg mb-4">
        Instead of content breaking to a new line causing more height in the
        overall UI I setup these components to push off to the right. We aim for
        this to never happen but were pleased with how graceful it fails.
      </p>
      <p class="lg:text-lg">
        Once things are 80% complete I ship a beta version of our component
        library with this AccordionList component. The backend developer starts
        building out in our app on their local build environment. This is where
        we discuss what works and what needs to be modified. This gives me time
        to clean up imperative code that can be more declarative, finalize lower
        priority functionality and write proper documentation.

      We've come full circle from discovery all the way to building out visually
      compelling, accessible React components in a component library. All of the
      fundamental elements are part of our design system and I can use Storybook
      or Figma components to layout all possibilities. Most importantly, we have
      a solid foundation for how employees and managers can manage their time
      and run payroll. 😄
