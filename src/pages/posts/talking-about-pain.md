I donâ€™t particularly care to talk about pain. There are many maxims about about pain, and I am not macho guy, but I simply felt there were better things to talk about. I didnâ€™t want to worry people, and frankly there are people out there in much worse pain. I realized recently, I donâ€™t know how to talk about pain, and that I had been ignoring it or living with it unnecessarily for too long.

When I was 16 I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis. If you donâ€™t know, itâ€™s an autoimmune disease where your own immune system attacks its own joints. I remember waking up one morning, trying to roll out of bed, and a shock of pain was so intense â€”Â it threw me onto my back. I cried. I cried walking up the stairs at school with a heavy backpack. I was on various medications. Vioxx, Enbrel, and Naproxen where among the list.

If you know me, you know I use the word â€˜hateâ€™ rarely. I believe there are few things in this world that should be reserved for such a word. I hated giving myself shots of Enbrel. I was a smoker. I didnâ€™t eat particularly healthy, and I lived in the moment. Some where in my early 20â€™s I said enough is enough. I proclaimed that I would not be on prescription drugs for the rest of my life. I was resolute about planning my life. Setting goals, meeting them, and setting more. I landed a good job, and had wonderful new relationships. I forgot about the drugs. I had gone into remission. Confirmed by blood tests of the time. In the years after, I never harped on the past. I told some people about my rheumatoid arthritis, and some denied I ever had it. It made me even question it at times, but ultimately I didnâ€™t care. I was living a life I wanted.

In 2020 the pandemic swept the country. At the time, I had been going to the gym 4 times a week, eating healthy, and had been in a wonderful relationship with my, now, wife. As happened for much of the tech sector, I started working remotely. I stopped going to the gym, and started worrying about my family. The ball of my left foot started get inflamed. I was going to my general doctor at the time, and he prescribed Naproxen. Fine, I had used it in the past, I know it worked well for me, but the pain never went away. It was affecting my running. Some days I would wake up with a limp. The pain was always worse in the mornings.

By 2021, it got worse, and I was not paying attention. A knuckle on my right pointer finger started swelling, was inflamed, and warm. You can see it in the above photo. My left wrist was experiencing sharp pain, and was also inflamed. I started working out more often in our basement gym, but I felt little energy to do it, and when I did Iâ€™d caused a shoulder impingement that was not healing. I tried new routines, moved from free weights to resistance bands as they did not aggravate my wrist as much. Something was off, and again I was not paying attention. I kept on with life as if it would all go away on itâ€™s own.

My wife and I flew to Kazakhstan so I could meet her family, and get to experience the culture she grew up in. I have a strange thing I do when I travel far distances. I fast. I believe it helps with jet lag. This was a long trip. I fasted for 38 hours. About 18 hours into the fast though I realized something. I had a substantial decrease in overall inflammation, but noticed it all over my body. By the time we got to our hotel, I couldnâ€™t believe the change. I couldnâ€™t believe the other pain I was dealing with, that I had not noticed, and how much my energy levels were affected.

I broke two distance running PRâ€™s in Kazakhstan. I got up early, most of the town is asleep, and Iâ€™d run through the Central Park of Karaganda. However, one day the ball of my left foot was so swollen, and in such pain, I couldnâ€™t make it down the stairs. My wifeâ€™s family are in the medial field. We got to a rheumatoid doctor out there who looked me over, and said I needed to treat this when I got back home. At this point, it was clear I was in denial. I fasted again on the trip back home. The temporary relief was enough to start understanding this was affecting my life more than I realized.

I made an appointment with a rheumatoid arthritis specialist, and was put on infusions. Shortly after, I realized how much physical pain I was really in. As the swelling reduced in my body, my brain also began to clear up. I never realized how mentally fatiguing this disease is. It is draining. Mentally, and physically. As a stubborn human being who still does not want to live his life on prescriptions, I stopped following up with the infusions, and went back to life. This felt like they had stabilized, but they were slowly getting worse.

As of February 2023, I am getting back on the medications that are help me get my body, and mind back. I do truly believe I will go back into remission, and I believe that these drugs are here to help me get to a place where I can get back into remissions. I need to get better talking about pain. Talking about pain In a way where I can convey the truth, calmly, and keeping a positive attitude for the future. This is my first step.
